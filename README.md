* **Small Smartphone (e.g., iPhone SE):** Single-column layout, hamburger menu for navigation, touch-friendly elements, and scaled images.
* **Tablet (e.g., iPad):** Optimized layout (e.g., 2-3 columns for products), larger touch targets, and correct orientation changes.
* **Desktop:** Full-width layout with multi-column displays and detailed content.

Testing was primarily conducted using **Chrome Developer Tools** in device emulation mode.
